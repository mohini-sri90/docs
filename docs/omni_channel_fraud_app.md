Omni Channel Fraud Prevention Application User Guide
====================================================

# Overview

**Omni Channel Fraud
Prevention** application is a pre-built application which can be used to identify frauds in financial transactions. This application is designed to ingest, transform, analyze, act, and visualize data as soon as it is generated thereby preventing fraud transactions in real time that is before it happens. You can view and monitor the historical and real-time data from the dashboards.

**Omni Channel Fraud Prevention** application is built over DataTorrent RTS platform and can be run on commodity hardware. The platform gives real time insights while providing fault tolerant and scalable way of processing. The fraud identification can be further customized by writing rules as per your business needs.

## Workflow

The following image presents the workflow of the application.

![](images/applications/omni_channel_fraud_app/workflow.png)
 
The following table lists the various processing phases of the incoming data tuples/event in **Omni Channel Fraud Prevention** application:

| **Phase** | **Process** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Transaction Ingestion | Data from all your input sources is pushed onto a message bus such as Apache kafka. The application leverages platform capabilities to ingest data from Kafka message bus to rest of its pipeline. Data tuples are filtered and transformed. The following operators are involved during Transaction ingestion: *Kafka Input Operator*, *Filter Operator*, *Transformation Operator*.|
| 2 | Transaction Enrichment | Data is enriched with the lookup information such as user profile data, card data, geo data, store profile data etc.The following operators are involved in the transaction enrichment phase: *Enricher*, *Geo Data*, *Customer Data*, *Card Data*, *Product Data*.|
| 3 | Fraud Rule Execution | Fraud detection rules are applied to the enriched data using drools as CEP Workbench. The following operators are involved in the Fraud Rule Execution phase: *Fraud Rule Executor*.|
| 4 | Analytics | Dimension computation is performed on the results and it is stored in a queryable format. The UI dashboards queries the data from the dimension compute store as well as from the auto metrics that are published by different DAG operators of the application. A unified view of the multiple app level widgets is provided, which helps to take actions in real time. For example, dedicated dashboards are shipped with application for executives, IT operations, and analytics. As per the role, a user can get their applicable metrics.The following operators are involved in the Analytics phase: *Dimension Computation*, *Store*, *Top Rules*, *Top N operators.* |
| 5 | Fraud Triggers and Alerts | Triggers are activated based on the output of the upstream processing. The processed transactions are written onto HDFS to run any historical analysis in future. Also, transactions are published on message bus such as kafka to take real time actions. The application is also integrated with alerting systems that send real time alerts to applicable users.  Email alerts are sent by default.The following operators are involved in the Fraud Triggers and Alerts phase: *Alert Mail*, *DataWriter*, *Kafka Output Operator*.|

# Troubleshooting

- **My App crashes immediately with Error stating:** _**Failed to construct kafka consumer**_

  _Solution_: Ensure that your kafka instance is up and running. Also check if your kafka server is accessible from your cluster hosts. Also check right if the kafka server configuration is provided to the operator.

- **My Enrichment operator crashes.**

  _Solution:_ Check if you have enrichment data in place. Also verify if enrichment file/data store is accessible from node. Also check  if the correct configuration is provided to the operator.

- **Latency of my application increases**

  _Solution:_ From DataTorrent RTS UI, check the operator which is a bottleneck. Increase operator memory by referring to the instructions on [datatorrent.com](http://docs.datatorrent.com). Also check Scaling section to add more resources for processing.

- **I don&#39;t see as many number of processed tuple at end operators as I receive from kafka / My tuples are getting filtered out.**

  _Solution:_ Check the following:
  - Check if the filter condition on the **Validator** operator is filtering out most of tuples. You can check that by looking at count of received tuples and processed tuples by the operator.
  - Check if enrichment is failing due to missing data. In case lookup data is missing enrichment operator can fail. By default, tuples are not passed on to the next operator if enrichment is failed. Based on your requirements either validate your lookup data or configure operators to pass on tuples in case of enrichment failures.
